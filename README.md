# meteor-url-shortener
It's a very simple application where you submit a url and receive shortened one. The application relies on [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) to process the links and return the shortened version.
There's nothing really special about the app, it's just a proof of concept and an attempt to implement certain packages and see how they fit together.
Anyway, if you've any suggestions or complains, you can create a pull request and I'll get back to you as soon as possible, cheers!

Just type in `npm start` and everything shall fire up perfectly!
